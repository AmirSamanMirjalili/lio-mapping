## 🤖 What is LIO-mapping?

### The Simple Explanation
LIO-mapping is like giving a robot the ability to **see and remember** its environment while **knowing where it is** at all times. Imagine a robot moving through a building - it needs to:

1. **See** the world around it (using a LiDAR sensor - like laser "eyes")
2. **Feel** its movement (using an IMU sensor - like an inner ear for balance)
3. **Remember** what it has seen (creating a map)
4. **Know** where it is on that map (localization)

### The Technical Explanation
LIO-mapping implements **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** using:
- **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging sensor that creates 3D point clouds
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Unit that measures acceleration and rotation
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines both sensors for robust estimation
- **Tightly Coupled**: The sensors work together intimately, not separately

### Why is this Important?
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars need to know where they are
- **Robots**: Indoor navigation, cleaning robots, delivery robots
- **Drones**: Autonomous flying in GPS-denied environments
- **AR/VR**: Real-time mapping for mixed reality applications

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- **Problem**: A robot doesn't know where it is AND doesn't have a map
- **Solution**: Build a map while figuring out your location on that map
- **Challenge**: It's a "chicken and egg" problem - you need location to build maps, and maps to know location

### LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
- **What it does**: Shoots laser beams in all directions and measures how long they take to bounce back
- **Output**: Point clouds - thousands of 3D points representing surfaces
- **Advantages**: Very accurate distance measurements, works in darkness
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, doesn't work well in fog/rain

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- **What it does**: Measures acceleration and rotation (like your phone's motion sensors)
- **Output**: Linear acceleration and angular velocity
- **Advantages**: High frequency updates, works everywhere
- **Disadvantages**: Drifts over time (errors accumulate)

### Sensor Fusion
- **Why needed**: Each sensor has strengths and weaknesses
- **LiDAR strength**: Accurate position, weak in motion estimation
- **IMU strength**: Good motion estimation, weak in absolute position
- **Together**: IMU helps between LiDAR scans, LiDAR corrects IMU drift

### Point Clouds
- **Definition**: Collection of 3D points representing surfaces in space
- **Structure**: Each point has X, Y, Z coordinates (and sometimes color/intensity)
- **Processing**: Extract features like corners, planes, edges for matching

## 🔧 Installation Guide

### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended for Beginners)

Docker provides a pre-configured environment that "just works" regardless of your system setup.

#### Step 1: Install Docker
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Docker
sudo apt install docker.io

# Add your user to docker group (logout and login after this)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Verify installation
docker --version
```

#### Step 2: Install NVIDIA Docker (for GPU support - optional)
```bash
# Add NVIDIA Docker repository
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

# Install nvidia-docker2
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-docker2

# Restart Docker daemon
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### Step 3: Build and Run with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmirSamanMirjalili/lio-mapping.git
cd lio-mapping

# Build Docker image (this takes 10-20 minutes)
cd docker
./build_docker.sh

# The run script automatically starts the system!
./run_docker.sh
```

**What happens when you run `./run_docker.sh`:**
- Starts a Docker container with GUI support (for RViz visualization)
- Automatically launches the indoor test configuration
- Opens RViz for 3D visualization
- Waits for you to play bag data

**Note**: The Docker script uses `nvidia-docker` for GPU support. If you don't have NVIDIA GPU, you can modify the script to use regular `docker` instead.

### Option 2: Native Installation

This gives you more control but requires more setup.

#### Step 1: Install ROS Melodic
```bash
# Set up ROS repository
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

# Install ROS
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

# Initialize rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update

# Set up environment
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install build tools
sudo apt install python-catkin-tools

# Install required libraries
sudo apt install libgoogle-glog-dev libatlas-base-dev libeigen3-dev libsuitesparse-dev

# Install PCL and OpenCV (usually comes with ROS)
sudo apt install libpcl-dev libopencv-dev

# Install Ceres Solver
wget http://ceres-solver.org/ceres-solver-1.14.0.tar.gz
tar zxf ceres-solver-1.14.0.tar.gz
mkdir ceres-bin
cd ceres-bin
cmake ../ceres-solver-1.14.0
make -j4
sudo make install
```

### Verification Tool

We've included a dependency checker script to help verify your installation:

```bash
# Run the dependency checker
cd lio-mapping
chmod +x scripts/check_dependencies.sh
./scripts/check_dependencies.sh
```

This script will check for all required dependencies and provide specific installation commands for missing components.

#### Step 3: Build LIO-mapping
```bash
# Create catkin workspace
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AmirSamanMirjalili/lio-mapping.git

# Build
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release lio

# Source the workspace
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🎯 Your First Run - Step by Step

### Prerequisites Check
Before we start, make sure you have:
- [ ] LIO-mapping successfully installed (Docker or native)
- [ ] Sample data downloaded
- [ ] Basic understanding of terminal commands

### Step 1: Download Sample Data
The original authors provide sample datasets that work out-of-the-box with the system.

```bash
# Create a directory for data
mkdir -p ~/lio_data
cd ~/lio_data

# Download from Google Drive link (you'll need to download manually)
# URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dPy667dAnJy9wgXmlnRgQF_ESuve3
# Look for files like: fast1.bag, slow1.bag, etc.
```

**Available datasets:**
- **fast1.bag**: Indoor environment, faster motion
- **slow1.bag**: Indoor environment, slower motion  
- **outdoor.bag**: Outdoor environment (if available)

**Understanding bag files:**
- `.bag` files are ROS data recordings
- They contain timestamped sensor data (LiDAR + IMU)
- Playing them simulates real-time sensor input

### Step 2: Understanding ROS Basics
ROS uses a publisher-subscriber system:
- **Nodes**: Individual programs that do specific tasks
- **Topics**: Named channels for communication
- **Messages**: Data packets sent over topics
- **Launch files**: Start multiple nodes with one command

### Step 3: Launch the System

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)
If you used Docker installation, the system launches automatically:
```bash
cd lio-mapping/docker
./run_docker.sh
# This automatically starts both the processor and mapping nodes
# RViz visualization opens automatically
```

#### Option B: Manual Launch (Native Installation)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start ROS master
roscore

# Terminal 2: Launch the processor (processes LiDAR data)
roslaunch lio test_indoor.launch

# Terminal 3: Launch the mapping node  
roslaunch lio map_4D_indoor.launch

# RViz should open automatically with the mapping launch
# If not, open manually: rviz -d $(rospack find lio)/rviz_cfg/lio_map_builder_indoor.rviz
```

### Step 4: Play Back Data
```bash
# Open a new terminal (or use existing if using Docker)
# Navigate to your data directory
cd ~/lio_data

# Play the bag file (replace with your actual bag file)
rosbag play fast1.bag

# Optional: Control playback speed
rosbag play fast1.bag --rate 0.5  # Play at half speed
rosbag play fast1.bag --rate 2.0  # Play at double speed
```

**Pro tips for bag playback:**
- Start with `--rate 0.5` (half speed) for first time
- Use `--pause` to start paused, then press space to begin
- Use `Ctrl+C` to stop playback

### Step 5: What to Expect

#### In RViz Visualization:
- **Point clouds**: Colored dots representing the environment
  - Red/Orange: Corner features (edges, sharp transitions)
  - Green/Blue: Surface features (planes, flat areas)
- **Trajectory**: Robot's path shown as a colored line
- **Map**: Accumulated point cloud showing the environment
- **Coordinate frames**: Showing sensor orientations

#### In Terminal Output:
You should see messages like:
```
[INFO] Processing frame 150/500
[INFO] Corner features: 45, Surface features: 120
[INFO] Optimization converged in 3 iterations
[INFO] Translation: [1.23, 2.45, 0.12], Rotation: [0.01, 0.02, 1.57]
```

#### Performance Indicators:
- **Frame rate**: Should process 10-20 Hz typically
- **Feature counts**: 30-100 corners, 80-200 surfaces per frame
- **Convergence**: Optimization should converge in 2-5 iterations

### Step 6: Monitor the Output
```bash
# List active topics
rostopic list

# Monitor specific topics
rostopic echo /lio_processor/laser_odom_to_init  # Odometry
rostopic echo /lio_sam/mapping/cloud_registered  # Registered points
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Understanding Configuration Files

#### Available Launch Files
The `launch/` directory contains different configurations for different scenarios:

```
launch/
├── test_indoor.launch        # Basic indoor testing (use this first!)
├── test_outdoor.launch       # Outdoor environments  
├── test_outdoor_64.launch    # 64-beam LiDAR outdoor
├── map_4D_indoor.launch      # Indoor mapping with visualization
├── map_4D.launch            # General mapping  
└── *_scans_test.launch      # Different LiDAR configurations
```

**Recommended combinations:**
- **First time**: `test_indoor.launch` + `map_4D_indoor.launch`
- **Outdoor data**: `test_outdoor.launch` + `map_4D.launch`
- **64-beam LiDAR**: `64_scans_test.launch` + `map_4D.launch`

#### Configuration File Structure (`config/` directory)
```
config/
├── indoor_test_config.yaml    # Indoor parameters (start here)
├── outdoor_test_config.yaml   # Outdoor parameters
└── outdoor_test_config_64.yaml # 64-beam LiDAR parameters
```

#### Indoor Test Config (`config/indoor_test_config.yaml`)
This file contains all the tunable parameters for indoor environments.

**Key Parameters Explained:**

```yaml
# Lidar Features
corner_filter_size: 0.2    # How much to downsample corner features

opt_window_size: 8           # More frames for outdoor optimization

# IMU settings for vehicle-mounted sensor
acc_n: 0.5                   # Higher noise due to vehicle vibrations
gyr_n: 0.05                  # Vehicle dynamics, road conditions
```

#### Scenario 3: Fast Motion / Racing Car
```yaml
# config/fast_motion_config.yaml
corner_filter_size: 0.3      # Balance detail vs speed
surf_filter_size: 0.5        # Coarser for fast processing
map_filter_size: 0.8         # Lower resolution for speed

window_size: 8               # Smaller window for fast updates
opt_window_size: 4           # Quick optimization

# IMU settings optimized for high dynamics
acc_n: 1.0                   # High acceleration noise
gyr_n: 0.1                   # High rotation rates
enable_deskew: 1             # Essential for fast motion
```

### Real-World Calibration Tips

#### LiDAR-IMU Extrinsic Calibration
**Method 1: Manual Measurement**
```yaml
# Measure physical offset between sensors
# Example: IMU is 10cm behind and 5cm below LiDAR
extrinsic_translation: !!opencv-matrix
  rows: 3
  cols: 1
  dt: d
  data: [-0.10, 0.0, -0.05]  # [x_back, y_left, z_down]
```

**Method 2: Automatic Calibration**
```yaml
# Start with rough estimate, let system refine
estimate_extrinsic: 1        # Optimize around initial guess
opt_extrinsic: 1            # Enable extrinsic optimization

# Initial rough guess
extrinsic_translation: !!opencv-matrix
  rows: 3
  cols: 1  
  dt: d
  data: [-0.08, 0.0, -0.03]  # Rough estimate
```

**Method 3: No Prior Knowledge**
```yaml
# Let system figure it out (requires good initialization motion)
estimate_extrinsic: 2        # Full automatic calibration
opt_extrinsic: 1            # Enable optimization

# No initial guess needed, but you must:
# 1. Start with stationary robot
# 2. Do slow rotation movements first
# 3. Then do translation movements
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between LIO-mapping and other SLAM algorithms?**
A: LIO-mapping specifically combines LiDAR and IMU sensors using tight coupling. Unlike loose coupling approaches that process sensors separately, tight coupling optimizes both sensor measurements together, resulting in better accuracy and robustness.

**Q: Can I use this with my own robot/sensor setup?**
A: Yes! LIO-mapping is designed to work with any LiDAR + IMU combination. You'll need to:
1. Calibrate the sensor extrinsics (relative positions)
2. Adjust the noise parameters for your specific sensors
3. Possibly modify topic names in launch files

**Q: What LiDAR sensors are supported?**
A: Any LiDAR that outputs ROS PointCloud2 messages. Common ones include:
- Velodyne VLP-16/32/64
- Ouster OS1/OS2 series  
- Livox Horizon/Mid series
- Robosense sensors

**Q: Do I need an expensive LiDAR?**
A: Not necessarily! While the original paper uses Velodyne sensors, the algorithm works with lower-cost sensors like:
- RPLiDAR A3 (2D, with modifications)
- Livox Mid-40 (~$600)
- Ouster OS1-16 (~$3500)

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why is my mapping result noisy/inaccurate?**
A: Common causes and solutions:
1. **Poor calibration**: Re-calibrate LiDAR-IMU extrinsics
2. **Wrong parameters**: Adjust filter sizes and noise parameters
3. **Fast motion**: Enable deskewing, reduce playback rate
4. **Environmental factors**: Some environments are harder (featureless areas, moving objects)

**Q: Can I run this in real-time on my robot?**
A: Yes, but consider:
- **CPU requirements**: Real-time needs powerful CPU (i7 or better)
- **Parameter tuning**: Increase filter sizes for speed
- **Frame rate**: LiDAR at 10Hz is typically manageable

**Q: How do I integrate GPS/other sensors?**
A: LIO-mapping doesn't directly support GPS, but you can:
1. Use GPS for initial localization
2. Fuse LIO-mapping output with GPS using robot_localization package
3. Convert between coordinate frames using standard ROS tools

**Q: My system crashes with large datasets. What can I do?**
A: Memory optimization strategies:
1. Reduce `window_size` in config (e.g., from 12 to 8)
2. Increase `map_filter_size` (e.g., from 0.6 to 1.0)
3. Process data in smaller segments
4. Use a machine with more RAM

### Development Questions

**Q: How can I add support for my custom sensor?**
A: Steps to add new sensors:
1. Create ROS driver that publishes PointCloud2 messages
2. Add sensor specifications to config file
3. Calibrate extrinsics between LiDAR and IMU
4. Test with sample data

**Q: Can I modify the algorithm for different applications?**
A: Absolutely! Common modifications:
- **Multi-robot SLAM**: Modify for data sharing between robots
- **Online mapping**: Add real-time map saving/loading
- **Semantic SLAM**: Integrate object detection
- **Visual fusion**: Add camera data (significant work)

**Q: How do I contribute bug fixes or improvements?**
A: Follow the contribution guidelines:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with clear description
5. Engage with review feedback

### Troubleshooting FAQ

**Q: "Cannot connect to X server" when using Docker**
A: Run this before starting Docker:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
export DISPLAY=:0
```

**Q: ROS nodes can't find each other**
A: Check that ROS_MASTER_URI is correct:
```bash
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI  # Should be http://localhost:11311
rosnode list          # Should show active nodes
```

**Q: Build fails with "Package not found"**
A: Ensure ROS environment is sourced:
```bash
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash  # or your ROS version
```

**Q: Performance is very slow**
A: Quick optimization checklist:
- [ ] Built in Release mode: `catkin build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- [ ] Increased filter sizes in config file
- [ ] Reduced window sizes in config file
- [ ] Playing bag at slower rate: `rosbag play --rate 0.5`
